# Telco_customer_churn

Customer churn is simply the rate at which customers leave doing business with an entity. 
Simply put, churn prediction involves determining the possibility of customers stopping doing business with an entity. 
In other words, if a consumer has purchased a subscription to a particular service, we must determine the 
likelihood that the customer would leave or cancel the membership.

It is a critical prediction for many businesses because acquiring new clients often costs more than retaining existing ones.
Customer churn measures how and why are customers leaving the business.The artificial neural network model (ANN) is a model that is 
inspired by how the human brain functions, which can be seen as a revival under the name “deep learning”. While deep learning shows 
great promise in many machine learning approaches, deep learning algorithms are often tuned and tailored very carefully to a particular use case.

we will build a customer churn prediction model using artificial neural network or ANN. Customer churn measures how and why are customers leaving the business.
WE will use telecom customer churn dataset from kaggle and build a deep learning model for churn prediction. 
We will also understand precision,recalll and accuracy of this model by using confusion matrix and classification report
